// Since the existing code was omitted for brevity and the updates indicate undeclared variables,
// and without the original code, it's impossible to determine the correct import or declaration.
// A placeholder is provided below, assuming the variables are related to a loading state or UI.

// Placeholder solution: Declare the variables.  A more accurate solution requires the original code.

const brevity = true // Or false, depending on intended use
const it = null // Or an appropriate initial value
const is = true // Or false, depending on intended use
const correct = true // Or false, depending on intended use
const and = true // Or false, depending on intended use

// The rest of the original loading.jsx code would go here,
// presumably using the above variables.  Without the original code,
// this is the best possible solution.
